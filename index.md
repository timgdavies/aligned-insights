The Catalyst is a collective involving digital organisations, funders, charities and the UK government. We are providing support for civil society organisations during the COVID-19 crisis. 

As part of this, we are working on improving the availability of **shared insights** on charity needs.

## Sharing insights

Hundreds of organisations and networks will be capturing data over the coming weeks to provide insight into non-profit needs. **What if it was easier to safely and responsibly bring that data together to drive deeper insights?**

We're providing creating light-weight standards and templates to help. 

**If you are collecting data on charity needs, we invite you to make use of these standards, and to pool your insight data with us.**

## A three step process

1. Use components from our [data templates](/templates/) in surveys or forms
2. Use common [categories](/categories/) when describing needs
3. Capture clear [consent](/consent/) to share or open the data you collect

## How we're using these standards

We've initially documented these standards for use amongst Catalyst collaborators. For example, we've using them as we gather data:

* From our operational work to connect anchor organisations with digital teams who can support them;
* From the anecdotal stories of charity need we're each hearing and sharing in a common slack channel;
* From survey data shared with us by partners who have carried out rapid assessments with their networks;

Over the coming weeks we are building a data store that can aggregate any data that approximates, or can be mapped to, our data templates and categories.
